K-mean clustering 
Environmental pollution is a critical issue affecting climate change and human health. Identifying patterns in environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, carbon emissions, and pollution levels can help policymakers take data-driven decisions. The goal of this project is to use K-Means clustering to group environmental conditions based on similarities.

Identify clusters of environmental conditions using K-Means clustering. Analyze relationships between carbon emissions and pollution levels. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method. Evaluate clustering performance using the Silhouette score. Provide insights into pollution control and sustainable policies. The dataset contains five environmental factors: Temperature (Â°C) Humidity (%) Wind Speed (km/h) Carbon Emissions (ppm) Pollution Level (AQI) The data is preprocessed by normalizing it using StandardScaler.
